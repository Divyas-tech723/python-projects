# Python Small Projects

This repository contains my collection of small Python programs.
Each project is created to practice core Python concepts and improve
my logical thinking through hands-on coding.

The programs are simple, beginner-friendly, and focused on one
concept at a time.

## Purpose
- Practice Python programming regularly
- Strengthen fundamentals through small projects
- Build consistency and problem-solving skills


## Note
Each Python file in this repository represents an independent
mini-project created as part of my daily learning process.
